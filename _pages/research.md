# 研究方向

团队是国内率先进行算法博弈和相关优化理论研究的团队之一。团队以合作博弈的算法与复杂性、次模优化、图结构与算法为研究主线。

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

#### 算法博弈(Algorithmic Game Theory)

**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? 

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips.



#### 次模优化(Submodular Optimization)

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.

**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. 

#### 图结构与算法(Graph Structures and Algorithm)

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial
