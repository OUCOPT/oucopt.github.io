## About the site

Our site is based on the template of [Allan Lab](http://www.allanlab.org/) and also inspired by the site of [Sanders Lab](https://sanderslab.github.io/). We greatly thank for them for allowing reuse of their codebase.

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/OUCOPT/repositories). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Allan Lab as the original sources of the lab website template).
