#### 简介

As a PI, Dr. Sanders co-leads the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) working group of the ASC with [Michael Talkowski](http://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu). This group developed the Category-Wide Association Study (CWAS) approach to WGS analysis, which provides a framework to define and account for the multiple comparisons inherent to these analyses ([Werling et al. Nature Genetics 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700473)). He is also a member of the Whole-Genome Sequencing in Psychiatric Disorders (WGSPD) steering group, which seeks to integrate WGS data across multiple disorders to maximize power ([Sanders et al. Nature Neuroscience 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29184211)).
