### Overview
Dr. Sanders trained as a pediatric physician in the UK before undertaking a PhD and postdoctoral research position at Yale. He is now an Associate Professor at UCSF in the Department of Psychiatry. His research focuses on using genomics and bioinformatics to understand the etiology of developmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

As a PI, Dr. Sanders co-leads the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) working group of the ASC with [Michael Talkowski](http://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu). This group developed the Category-Wide Association Study (CWAS) approach to WGS analysis, which provides a framework to define and account for the multiple comparisons inherent to these analyses ([Werling et al. Nature Genetics 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700473)). He is also a member of the Whole-Genome Sequencing in Psychiatric Disorders (WGSPD) steering group, which seeks to integrate WGS data across multiple disorders to maximize power ([Sanders et al. Nature Neuroscience 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29184211)).
